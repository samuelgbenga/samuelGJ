June 13:

- make sure to return the correct sql error to the frontend to know what is going on.
- the frontend should intercept and display something on the user side.
- but they should know where the error is coming from.


(now)
- stars of project (gitub stars) should be a single number that can be updated
accessible without authentication
- clap on articles - (medium claps) same as github

(Later)
